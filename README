This is set of C++ interfaces for bicpl functionality but it is NOT a
full C++ API for bicpl.  Rather, bicpl++ contains "glue" code to interface
bicpl with C++ libraries, such as CGAL and Inventor.

You must have bicpl and its attendant libraries installed before building
bicpl++.

See INSTALL and INSTALL.bicpl++ for installation instructions.
